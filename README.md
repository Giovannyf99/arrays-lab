# JavaScript Array Lab Exercises

In this lab, you are going to practice the basics of writing **for loops and while loops**, using JavaScript as a programming language, by completing problems that will challenge your knowledge of core princples. 

## Objectives 

- constructing a `for` loop
- constructin a `while` loop
- What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop


## Instructions 

- **Fork** this repo to your account by clicking on the **fork** Button at the top of this page.

- Copy the path in the dialoge box
- Navigate to a location on **your local computer in VSCode** where you keep your homework 
- Clone this repsository by typing the following command in your terminal

```
clone [`path that you just copied`]
```

For example: 

```bash 
clone https://github.com/DigitalCraftsStudents/js-lab-arrays.git
```

- Navigate into the folder titled `js-lab-arrays`
- Open the file called `arrays.js` and solve the lab problems 
- To run a file javascript file using node, you can run it from your terminal like this:

```bash
$ node loops.js
```


## Problems

1. Create a new array called `planets` that holds all of the names of the planets
in our solar system. Print the list of planets on the command line.

```js 
let planet1 = "Earth"
let planet2 = "Jupiter"
let planet3 = "Neptune"
let planet4 = "Mars"
let planet5 = "Saturn"
let planet6 = "Mercury"
let planet7 = "Uranus"
let planet8 = "Venus"

```

2. What is the index of **Mars**?

3. Print **Mars** to the command line from the `planet` array.

4. Print **Saturn** to the command line from the `planet` array.

5. Print **Venus** to the command line from the `planet` array.

6. Print out how many elements are in the `planet` array.

7. Loop through the `planet` array using a for loop and print the name of each planet.

8. Create a while loop that iterates through each of the items in the `planet` array
and changes each element to lowercase.

9. Add **Pluto** to the `planet` array.

10. Loop through each planet in the `planet` array and print them on the command line.

11. Since **Pluto** isn't really a planet, delete it from the `planet` array.

12. Loop through the `planet` array and print the updated values (Pluto removed).

13. Create a new array called `nums` with the following values

```text
6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
```

14. Loop through `nums`  and print each number to the command line. 

15. Add 99 to the end of the `nums` array.

16. Add 23 to the beginning of the `nums` array. 

17. Loop through `nums` and multiply each number by 5. 

18. Sum all of the elements of the `nums` array.
